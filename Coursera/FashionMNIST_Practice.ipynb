There's another, similar dataset called MNIST which has items of handwriting -- the digits 0 through 9.\n","\n","Write an MNIST classifier that trains to 99% accuracy or above, and does it without a fixed number of epochs -- i.e. you should stop training once you reach that level of accuracy.\n","\n","Some notes:\n","1. It should succeed in less than 10 epochs, so it is okay to change epochs to 10, but nothing larger\n","2. When it reaches 99% or greater it should print out the string \"Reached 99% accuracy so cancelling training!\"\n","3. If you add any additional variables, make sure you use the same names as the ones used in the class\n","\n","I've started the code for you below -- how would you finish it?
