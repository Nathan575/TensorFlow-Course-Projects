The number of color channels represents the depth of an image and coorelates to the colors used in it. For example, an image with three channels is likely made up of rgb (red, green, blue) pixels. So, for each pixel we have three numeric values in the range 0-255 that define its color. For an image of color depth 1 we would likely have a greyscale image with one value defining each pixel, again in the range of 0-255.\n","\n","![alt text](http://xrds.acm.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Figure1.png)\n","\n","Keep this in mind as we discuss how our network works and the input/output of each layer. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9mqznmTh--v2","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##Convolutional Neural Network\n","**Note:** I will use the term *convnet* and convolutional neural network interchangably.\n","\n","Each convolutional neural network is made up of one or many convolutional layers. These layers are different than the *dense* layers we have seen previously. Their goal is to find patterns from within images that can be used to classify the image or parts of it. But this may sound familiar to what our densly connected neural network in the previous section was doing, well that's becasue it is. \n","\n","The fundemental difference between a dense layer and a convolutional layer is that dense layers detect patterns globally while convolutional layers detect patterns locally. When we have a densly connected layer each node in that layer sees all the data from the previous layer. This means that this layer is looking at all the information and is only capable of analyzing the data in a global capacity.

Even the basic example we will use in this guide will be made up of 3 convolutional layers. These layers work together by increasing complexity and abstraction at each subsequent layer. The first layer might be responsible for picking up edges and short lines, while the second layer will take as input these lines and start forming shapes or polygons. Finally, the last layer might take these shapes and determine which combiantions make up a specific image.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ii-a9rXzRwNi","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##Feature Maps\n","You may see me use the term *feature map* throughout this tutorial.

The number of filters in a convolutional layer reprsents how many patterns each layer is looking for and what the depth of our response map will be.

model above takes a few minutes to train in the NoteBook and only gives an accuaracy of ~70%. This is okay but surely there is a way to improve on this. \n","\n","In this section we will talk about using a pretrained CNN as apart of our own custom network to improve the accuracy of our model. We know that CNN's alone (with no dense layers) don't do anything other than map the presence of features from our input. This means we can use a pretrained CNN, one trained on millions of images, as the start of our model. This will allow us to have a very good convolutional base before adding our own dense layered classifier at the end. In fact, by using this techique we can train a very good classifier for a realtively small dataset (< 10,000 images). This is because the convnet already has a very good idea of what features to look for in an image and can find them very effectively. So, if we can determine the presence of features all the rest of the model needs to do is determine which combination of features makes a specific image.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"u10oZO1oXT6Y","colab_type":"text"},"source":["###Fine Tuning\n","When we employ the technique defined above, we will often want to tweak the final layers in our convolutional base to work better for our specific problem. This involves not touching or retraining the earlier layers in our convolutional base but only adjusting the final few. We do this because the first layers in our base are very good at extracting low level features lile lines and edges, things that are similar for any kind of image. Where the later layers are better at picking up very specific features like shapes or even eyes.
